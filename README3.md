## Requirements

The basic requirements to do this project are:

- ROS
- Stage simulator

## Project Goal

The aim of this project is to create a ROS application in order to control a swarm of robots in a Simulator Stage using the Reynolds Rules.

The instructions are the following:

Implement basic Reynolds rules:
   1. separation
   2. alignment
   3. cohesion

Test the implementation in the Stage simulator in the map with a frame.

2. Implement additional Reynolds rules for:
   1. navigation to a given point
   2. obstacle avoidance

Test the implementation in the Stage simulator in the following maps:
   1. a map with a frame (useful to keep boids inside certain space)
   2. a map with different types of obstacles (useful to test obstacle avoidance rules)
   3. a simple maze map (useful to test the combination of obstacle avoidance and navigation rules)
   4. a hard maze map (useful to test the combination of obstacle avoidance and navigation rules)
