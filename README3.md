## Requirements

The basic requirements to do this project are:

- ROS
- Stage simulator

## Project Goal

The aim of this project is to create a ROS application in order to control a swarm of robots in a Simulator Stage using the Reynolds Rules.

The instructions are the following:

1. Implement basic Reynolds rules:
   1. separation
   2. alignment
   3. cohesion

</div>

   Test the implementation in the Stage simulator in the map with a frame.

2. Implement additional Reynolds rules for:
   1. navigation to a given point
   2. obstacle avoidance

   Test the implementation in the Stage simulator in the following maps:
   1. a map with a frame (useful to keep boids inside certain space)
   2. a map with different types of obstacles (useful to test obstacle avoidance rules)
   3. a simple maze map (useful to test the combination of obstacle avoidance and navigation rules)
   4. a hard maze map (useful to test the combination of obstacle avoidance and navigation rules)

## Explanation of Files and Directories

**`/sphero_stage/example.yml`:**
- Implementation for display in a multiple terminal environment (tmux).

**`/sphero_stage/package.xml`:**
- Project information, including project name, description, creator, maintainer, license, dependencies, and export details.

**`/sphero_stage/CMakeLists.txt`:**
- Package management and configuration.

**`/sphero_stage/launch/launch_params.yaml`:**
- Configuration options for launching:
- Number of robots: `num_of_robots`
- Map selection: `map_name`
- Robot formation: `distribution`

**`/sphero_stage/launch/start.py/`:**
- Create world
- Launch stage simulator

**`/sphero_stage/resources/`:**
- Do not modify unless adding new maps.
- Contains various maps used in the simulation.

**`/sphero_stage/src/sphero_stage/`:**
- Place Python files developed for the execution of movements and/or behaviors here.

## Execution

To test our program you have to run the next commands:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In the first terminal run the following command

**`roslaunch sphero_stage setup_sim.xml`**

In the second terminal run the following command

**`rosrun sphero_stage alignment.py`**

In RVIZ use 2D Nav goal to select a position on the map to give the target position.
